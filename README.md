# Dynamic Arrays and Memory Layout Exploration

## Overview

Honestly, this project started off as a curiosity to see how dynamic arrays work under the hood, and just kind of grew legs from there in terms of implementation and features. It's a combination of "What ifs" and a
lot of research on memory layout, and systems architecture in general.

Here, you will find a deep dive into the mechanics of dynamic arrays, memory allocation, and other related topics in systems programming. It's not perfect by any means, but it's definitely fun! Pitstop 1 on my
journey to systems programming with the beautiful if not a bit quirky, C language.

## Features

- **Dynamic Array Implementation**: Explore how dynamic arrays are implemented from scratch, including resizing, memory allocation, and deallocation.
- **Systems Architecture**: Insights into low-level programming and how hardware and software interact.
- **Memory Layout**: A good grasp of memory layout, and how a systems Word size determines the total number of allowable unique addresses within the Virtual Address Space, helped a lot for this mini-project.
